 <h3>What is Fitness?</h3>
 <p>Fitness has many definitions given by people in the entire fitness career. Fitness can be defined in simple terms a way of life where you take care of your body by exercising and eating healthy foods. Yes fitness is this much only but we upgrade each thing that exists in this world. Now people are considered fit only when they have six pack abs or big biceps, in a nutshell a <b>BodyBuilder.</b> No, not everyone needs to have big biceps or six pack abs, one can be healthy without making such kind of body.

     <h3>Why Fitness?</h3>

     <p>There are so many benefits once you become fit but let's talk who is fit. One who is not overweight or underweight, does not carry excess fat, has more muscle mass and is in discipline,can be considered as a fit person. One who exercises, who eats more healthy foods is a fit or a healthy person. <br> <strong>Benefits of being fit- <br> &dot; Has good mindset, works deeply, does not give up on small things, maintains discipline. <br> &dot; Has more stamina compared to others, is wise enough to judge things, controls egoistic thinking. <br> &dot; Can learn things quickly and all. </strong> <br> Well we talked about the benefits but this varies. Not everyone can attain these benefits even if she is fit as some factors depend on maturity. For example an unmatured would definitely struggle even if he tries to, while some grasp things without a stress. The benefits I mentione are incomplete because I cannot say what type of benefit a person gains.
    Now we will talk how a person can get fit.</p>

   <h3>How to get fit?</h3>

   <p>To get fit we will mention how an overweight, underweight and avergae person get's fit. <br><b>Overweight:</b> Overweight generally means that a person has excesss weight compared to his height or other factors. People who are overweight are obese, face diseases frequently and get tired quickly. Well some fat people don't get tired easily or diseases frequently because they became fat by eating healthy stuffs in excess amount. <a href="maintain.html" class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">Click Here To Know More</a> So the ones who face obesity are the ones who became fat by consuming more junk food, refined sugar, refined flour and bad fat. So we can directly say that when you quit foods such mentioned above, yes yo get fit. By adding some exercises you are good to go... but wait? What should I eat then?<br>Here are steps you can foolow to get yourself fit ;) <br><b>I</b> Quit those unhealthy foods and get yourself more attached to foods which have complex carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats and good amount of fibre. For example Oats, Fish, Chicken, Chickpeas, Eggs, Meat, Chapati, Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Green Leafy Veggies, Nuts. <br><b>II</b> Start drinking water from 1litre/day to 4-5 litres/day (don't go for more). Water reduces your cravings, increases flow of blood circulation, helps kidneys to function well, reduces stress also, flushes out harmful material from the body. It has a significant role when it comes to fat loss. <br> <b>III</b>Start building muscle, you can join the gym. See calories in has to be less than calories out which means you have to eat less(food) than you burn throughout the day. Less doesn't mean decrease it to some great extent but just eat slightly less than your maintainence calories <a href="maintain.html" class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">(Click here to know more about)</a>. Calories are burnt more when your basal metabolic rate increases and so muscle building boost basal metabolic rate. Hitting the gym and lifting weight will help you build muscle. Yes proper nutrition must be there. <br><b>IV</b>Don't overdo exercises at the first day itself, you need to give time to your body to adapt the change. There is a chance you might throw up but don't worry this was just a response to the change in the stimulus. Remenber its a 80% diet and 20% exercise ratio, even if you exercise for 24hrs and your diet isn't nutritious, you won't see any progress. <br> <b>Underweight:</b>The one who's weight is low compared to his height and other factors. You'll recognise a person as skinny the moment you see him as you see a fat person. Even the skinny person face tiredness and diseases often due poor nutrition on the body.<br>Here are steps you can foolow to get yourself fit ;) <br><b>I</b> Quit those unhealthy foods and get yourself more attached to foods which have complex carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats and good amount of fibre. For example Oats, Fish, Chicken, Chickpeas, Eggs, Meat, Chapati, Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Green Leafy Veggies, Nuts(Yes this is mandatory even for a skinny. You won't gain mass by eating unhealthy due to your genetics and other factors). <br><b>II</b>Yes you can hit the gym to grow your size. The foods mentioned above are to be taken slightly more than your maintainence calories <a href="maintain.html" class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">(Click here to know more about)</a>. Don't eat too much thinking your skinny this would only cause digestive problems and get you sick. <a href="video.html" class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">Check this video :)</a> <br><b id="gethere">Average:</b>An average is the one who has balanced muscle and fat proportion in his body, and his weight is fine compared to his height and other factors. Well we have already mentioned what an avergae person would require to get fit. Could'nt find?.... The answer lies if you read about underweight and overweight. Yes the foods that they seek for are to be taken by an average in order to get him fit. Average guys don't need to hit the gym or so, you can do some cardio or compound movement to get you fit. More over everyone who lose weight or gains weight seek fitness for their upcoming life.</p>
 <br>
   <h3><strong>Fitness is not a journey it's a destination: This is because one who lost weight might face a time where he would be broken or stressed out and start consuming junk again. This is so as not everyone has strong will power to tackle stress or breakup. Since junks are great for those who are in stress "according to some people" they end up losing willpower. Now they are fat again right? Yes they are but not forever they'll realize what had been wrong and again get back to this journey and that's why it's called fitness is a journey not a destination. Also some people work hard when they get broke, where as some are just like the above.</strong></h3>
